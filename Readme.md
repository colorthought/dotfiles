# Dotfiles
My modest little vimrc. After a hard drive failure, I figured it was high time to do version control on my configuration and mappings. I'll continue to update this as it gets more involved. Feel free to use!

To install:

        git clone https://github.com/colorthought/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
        cd ~/dotfiles
        sh install_vimrc.sh
change        
Enjoy!
